# businesscapabilities

The Business Capabilities repository includes content about business capability modeling, a topic I have been researching and writing about since 2009.  Since some of the articles I've written on this topic are no longer available at [Architecture & Governance Magazine](http://architectureandgovernance.com/), I thought I'd post them here so they are still accessible on the internet.
