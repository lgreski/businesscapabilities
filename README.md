# businesscapabilities

The Business Capabilities repository includes content about business capability modeling, a topic I have been researching and writing about since 2009.  Since some of the articles I've written on this topic are no longer available at [Architecture & Governance Magazine](http://architectureandgovernance.com/), I thought I'd post them here so they are still accessible on the internet.

# Recent Work

Articles on architecture topics that are still accessible at the sources originally published on the internet include:

* [Getting Beyond Ourselves:](https://bit.ly/3yPFWbI) Describes a results-oriented approach to the practice of architecture
* [Solution Architecture - A Structural Approach to Value:](https://bit.ly/3afG7mQ) Outlines four ways that effective solution architecture generates measurable value
